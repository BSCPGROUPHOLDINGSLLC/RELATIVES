Local Law 1 of 2004 - Lead-Based Paint=0D
(Lead-Based Paint)=0D
Local Law 1 of 2004 establishes that there is a presumption of lead-based=
 paint in a building if it is 1) tenant occupied; 2) built prior to 1960;=
 and 3) a child under the age of six resides in the unit. "Resides" means=
 to live in the apartment or to routinely spend ten or more hours in the =
apartment each week. The law outlines requirements for identifying where =
a child under 6 resides, required even if the owner believes they know th=
e ages of the occupants, and how those apartments must be maintained. The=
 law has additional requirements for all tenant-occupied apartments built=
 prior to 1960, regardless of the age of the occupants. The law applies t=
o studio apartments (zero bedroom) as well. The law also applies to build=
ings built between 1960 and 1978 if lead-based paint is known to exist. O=
wners must retain records of all of the required activities for at least =
10 years and provide the records to HPD on request. HPD may audit these r=
ecords and is more likely to do so if your building has a history of lead=
-based paint violations or other indications of poor maintenance. Penalti=
es may be significant for failure to conduct these activities and maintai=
n these records. More information is available on the HPD website, includ=
ing sample forms to assist with recordkeeping: nyc.gov/lead-based-paint.=0D=

=0D
=0D
Exemption: Major alterations to the building do not automatically exempt =
the building from these requirements. In order to be exempt from the requ=
irements, an owner must apply for and receive exemption issued directly f=
rom HPD. The application for exemption is available on the HPD lead-based=
 paint webpage. There are additional reasons a building may be excluded f=
rom the requirements of Local Law 1 and those are addressed under Questio=
n 1.=0D
=0D
=0D
Year Built: HPD records indicate that your building was built prior to 19=
60 or, if built between 1960 and 1978, has had lead-based paint violation=
s issued, which indicates the presence of lead-based paint. Under both of=
 these year-built parameters, you are required to comply with the require=
ments of Local Law 1. If you disagree with the year built in HPD records =
(meaning your Certificate of Occupancy (COO) shows that a new building wa=
s erected after January 1, 1960), please email HPD at codevios@hpd.nyc.go=
v and provide the following so HPD can update its records: building addre=
ss; borough; and correct information for the year built, including suppor=
ting documentation such as the COO. Note: Major alterations do not affect=
 the year-built requirements. See "Exemption" above.=0D
