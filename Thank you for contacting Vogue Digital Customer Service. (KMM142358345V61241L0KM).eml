2. At the bottom of the app, tap on "My Account" then tap "All Access".

A. Follow the instructions above, but choose the "Coupon Code" option in
step 3 instead of Account Number. Enter your coupon code and tap

Please note that each code can only be redeemed once. 
 
Q: I submitted my account number and zip code, but it gave me the error,

A: If you have set up digital access for this or another Conde Nast 
brand, then you may simply login using your existing email address and 
password to enjoy your Vogue subscription. 
 
Q: I tried to create a login using my email address, but I received an 
error message that said "this e-mail address is already registered." 
 
A: It is possible that you have already linked your print subscription 
with a tablet edition, so you must sign in using your existing email 
address and password. Please go to the Library tab and tap "Sign In" at 
the top left corner. Enter your email address and password 
(case-sensitive) to begin reading or purchasing issues immediately. 
 
Q: I submitted my name and address, but it couldn't find my

A: Please make sure you have entered your name and address exactly as 
they appear on you mailing label. Also note that only the first 5 digits
of your zip code are required. 
 
Q: I have already linked my account. Do I have to enter my account 
information each time I want to access my digital issues? 
 
A: No. Once you link your account, you may simply sign in with your 
login email and password to enjoy your Vogue subscription. 
 
Q: I have a login from www.vogue.com , but I don't remember my password.
Can I reset my password? 
 
A: Yes, to reset your password in the app, go to the "Sign In" option 
and click on the "Forgot Password?" link. Or, you may go to My Account 
and tap the "forgot Password" bar. You will receive an email with a link
to rest your password. Otherwise, email customer care at 
VOGdigital@cdsfulfillment.com 
 
General Digital Edition and Subscription Questions 
 
Q: As a digital subscriber through iTunes, how do I turn off the auto 
renewal function? 
 
A: iTunes, digital only subscriptions will be automatically renewed 
until auto renewal is turned off. Otherwise, Apple will bill you at the 
beginning of each subscription period. To turn off auto renew, please 
follow these steps from your iPad: 
 
1. From your device's Home screen, tap the Settings icon. 
 
2. On the left hand side under Settings, tap on "iTunes & App Store".  
Then on the right hand side, tap on your Apple ID. 
 
3. Tap "View Apple ID" and enter your password. 
 
4. From your account page, scroll down and tap "Manage" under 
"Subscriptions".  If you do not have app subscriptions, this button will
not be displayed. 
 
5. Tap the magazine that you want to update/renew. 
 
6.  Slide auto-renew to the "off" position, or select the term for which
you would like to renew. 
 
Q: Can I read Vogue without purchasing a subscription? 
 
A: Yes, you may read Vogue on your tablet by purchasing single issues. 
Simply tap on the "Buy Issue" button next to any of the published issues
to make your purchase. Once an issue is purchased, simply click the 
"Download" button or Cloud icon next to the cover to download the issues
and enjoy reading. 
 
Q: Some of the issues that I purchased are missing. How can I access 
them? 
 
A: First make sure you sign in using the same account you used to 
purchase the issues. Next, go to the Library tab and click on the cog 
symbol in the top right corner. Click "Restore All Purchases." If you're
missing issues do not appear, please contact iTunes directly for further
assistance. 
 
Q: Do I need an internet connection to read my digital issues? 
 
A: No, all of our digital editions are designed for reading offline once
issues have downloaded. An internet connection is required for some 
features, however, and high bandwidth (Wi-Fi) is recommended. 
 
Q: I am having technical issues with the app. What can I do? 
 
A: First, make sure you have the most updated version of the app. Go 
into your App Store and check to see if you have any updates for Vogue. 
Or, you may need to restart the application by double-tapping the round 
home button on the bottom front of your iPad. The apps that are running 
on your device will appear in a row.  Close out all of the running 
programs.  This does not delete the app, it just stops it from running. 
Double-tap the home button again to return to your home screen. 
 
Q: How do I get the latest issue of Vogue to automatically download? 
 
A: Here is how to enable automatic downloads on your iPhone, iPad, or 
iPod touch:
