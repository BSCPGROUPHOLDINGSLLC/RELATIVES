sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for dama=
ges caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he a=
cted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or =
misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or =

t before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury de=
termines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, wo=
uld, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the liquidity or efficiency =
of the market for government securities; or (ii) impose any burden on com=
petition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of t=
his section, the Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, f=
