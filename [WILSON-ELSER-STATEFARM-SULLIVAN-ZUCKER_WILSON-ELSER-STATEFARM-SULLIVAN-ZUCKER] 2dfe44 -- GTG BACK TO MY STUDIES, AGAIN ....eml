DRP not required by the Directors of State Farm VP Management Corp.?=0D
- Attached are communications between 3/31/2021 and as of current - for a=
voidance to an accuracy related penalty as attested by the Directors of t=
he former CIK 93715 ( which has ceased to exist ) - in their current file=
r as the same CRD MEMBERS under the auspice of FINRA in filer CIK 1516523=
 have under CERT 63.18 failed to disclose any "legal proceeding", or "cla=
ims" after having participated in the letter of credit annexed in NYSCEF =
matter 153974/2020 - and that there is "NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT"=0D=

=0D
Hence, it is important to keep those Directors in check, and more specifi=
cally the 9 executive links AFTER they don't update anything.=0D

in the 311-REPOSITORY, no address required there either as forward guidan=

FILED, however was a complaint FOR 111 REAR SULLIVAN STREET, where I file=
d a " NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY COMPLAINT " as a document uploaded the =
prior filed NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY that I annexed in the matter and =
on the 4th of August in 2020=0D
=0D
- I am certain the supervisor then and now have had an issue with the int=
ernet, as they were "unable to gain access to the building" to check on t=
he "unlawful use of property" and "NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY" complaint=
 I filed with the Department of Buildings then, continues to report "unla=
wful" gross income to the NYC Finance Register for them to evaluate and a=
utomatically propagate a "MARKET VALUE" using the "base cap rate" - which=
 is the "ordinary rate an investor would expect on real property"=0D
---- as promulgated therein the receipts and by NYC Department of Finance=
 in the Public Record, were more likely than not also issued to their inv=
estors and used to obtain a letter of credit as well, from State Farm in =
May of 2020, annexed in the matter as referenced hereunder.=0D

Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any applic=

isleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or =
sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for dama=
ges caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he a=
cted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or =
misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or =
in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the co=
urt may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the=
 costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable at=

(5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the Secret=

blishes its reasons therefor. If the Secretary of the Treasury comments i=
n writing to the Commission on a proposed rule that has been published fo=

t before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the Treasury de=
termines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule, if implemented, wo=

- Attached are communications between 3/31/2021 and as of current - for a=
voidance to an accuracy related penalty as attested by the Directors of t=
he former CIK 93715 ( which has ceased to exist ) - in their current file=
r as the same CRD MEMBERS under the auspice of FINRA in filer CIK 1516523=
 have under CERT 63.18 failed to disclose any "legal proceeding", or "cla=
ims" after having participated in the letter of credit annexed in NYSCEF =
matter 153974/2020 - and that there is "NOTHING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT"=0D=

=0D
Hence, it is important to keep those Directors in check, and more specifi=
cally the 9 executive links AFTER they don't update anything.=0D
=0D
- The TIPS I filed earlier as well, for convenience are held "somewhere" =
in the 311-REPOSITORY, no address required there either as forward guidan=

FILED, however was a complaint FOR 111 REAR SULLIVAN STREET, where I file=
d a " NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY COMPLAINT " as a document uploaded the =
prior filed NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY that I annexed in the matter and =
on the 4th of August in 2020=0D
=0D
- I am certain the supervisor then and now have had an issue with the int=
ernet, as they were "unable to gain access to the building" to check on t=
he "unlawful use of property" and "NO CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY" complaint=
 I filed with the Department of Buildings then, continues to report "unla=
wful" gross income to the NYC Finance Register for them to evaluate and a=
utomatically propagate a "MARKET VALUE" using the "base cap rate" - which=
 is the "ordinary rate an investor would expect on real property"=0D
---- as promulgated therein the receipts and by NYC Department of Finance=
 in the Public Record, were more likely than not also issued to their inv=
