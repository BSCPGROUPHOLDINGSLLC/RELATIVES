The two points summary the substantive requirement for Open Data to be considered widely available, and interpretable by several agencies – and provided that it does meet the two standards below, as referenced in our reading assignment must meet these two minimum standards to be considered ―valuable‖ and in the scope of ―Open Data‖ as referenced in the body of the article must be:
A. Technically open:

―[data] available in a machine-readable standard format, which means it can be retrieved and meaningfully processed by a computer application.‖ (Shueh, 3)

The Department of Justice's (DOJ) Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is responsible for the care and custody of over 151,000 inmates, traffickers of drugs and their Policy Information Notices (PINs) is in fact another conduit of what is the expanse of information beyond what is understood as PROTECTED, even by, for example a director of the Federal Bureau of Investigations is beyond the scope of traditional thinking in an arena of "purported" complex litigation.

B. Legally open:
―[data] explicitly licensed in a way that permits commercial and non-commercial use and re-use without restrictions.‖ (Shueh, 4)


As introduced previously ―...Interoperability denotes the ability of diverse systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate). In this case, it is the ability to interoperate — or intermix — [across] different data sets…" (Shueh, 4). An example where Open Data is used as a system of checks and balances to ensure compliance, further supports the expansion of "…The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, or DATA Act, if approved, would publish all federal agency expenditures and would require that data best standardized and reviewed to prevent abuse..." (Shueh, 5) is important to observe beyond the Covid-19 expansion of mandates prior to making any further statement — as exemplified previously in the article on DIKW — we need data in order to make an informed decision.
In continuance of the points above, it would also follow suit to observe the four steps to make an appropriate decision to forecast any further the changes in any

1. Data Set.
2. Attach an Open License.
3. Format the Data to revweal what is demanded.
4. Make it Discoverable

Controversial opinions are generally what cause the most challenges as to what, when and how data should be "visualized"



Lastly, I found the following statement equally reflective and to summarize the bullet points above from the same page:


“Management must be informed enough to make an effective contribution to system design, and information specialists (including systems analysts, accountants and operations researchers) must become more aware of managerial functions and needs so that, jointly, more effective MIS are developed.” (Adeoti, 326).
There is abundant evidence from numerous surveys conducted in developed countries, particularly in the UK and USA, that existing MIS, often using advanced computer equipment, have had relatively little success in providing management with the information it needs. Reasons discovered include the following:
• lack of management involvement with the design of the MIS;
• narrow or inappropriate emphasis of the computer system;
• undue concentration on low-level data processing applications particularly in the accounting area;
• poor appreciation by information specialists of management’s true information requirements and of organizational problems; and
• lack of top management support.
Generally, I agree with the principle of anonymity when it comes to research and data production. This was well introduced in the short form as referenced in Boulton:
“The privacy of data subjects needs to be protected.” (Boulton, 2)
