 [t]he proper functioning of the securities industry and markets depends on=
 the
 integrity of industry participants and their commitment to transparent dis=
closure.
 Securities industry participation by persons with a history of fraudulent =
conduct is
 antithetical to the protection of investors. . . . We have long held that =
a history of
 egregious fraudulent conduct demonstrates unfitness for future participati=
on in the
 securities industry even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to th=
e
 professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she en=
gaged
 in the misconduct underlying the proceeding. The industry relies on the fa=
irness
 and integrity of all persons associated with each of the professions cover=
ed by the
 collateral bar to forgo opportunities to defraud and abuse other market
 participants.

 Injunctions against gross abuse.
 SEC. 36.
 The Commission is authorized to bring an action in the proper district cou=
rt of the United States or United States court of
 any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the United Sta=
tes, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or more of the followi=
ng capacities has been guilty, after the enactment of this title and within=
 five years of the commencement of the action, of gross misconduct or gross=
 abuse of trust in respect of any registered investment company for which s=
uch person so serves or acts:
 (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser,=
 or depositor; or
 (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an open-end co=
mpany, unit investment trust, or face-amount
 certificate company.
 If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross abuse of=
 trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person from acting in s=
uch capacity or capacities either permanently or for such period of time as=
 it in its discretion shall deem appropriate.

      (a)Persons liable; persons entitled to recover; defense of good
      faith; suit at law or in equity; costs, etc.<br>
      Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any
      application, report, or document filed pursuant to this chapter or
      any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in
      a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section
      78o of this title, which statement was at the time and in the
      light of the circumstances under which it was made false or
      misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to
      any person (not knowing that such statement was false or
      misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have
      purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such
      statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person
      sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge
      that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to
      enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of
      competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its
      discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of
      such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
      attorneys=E2=80=99 fees, against either party litigant.<br>
      <br>
      (b)Contribution<br>
      Every person who becomes liable to make payment under this section
      may recover contribution as in cases of contract from any person
      who, if joined in the original suit, would have been liable to
      make the same payment.<br>
      <br>
      (c)Period of limitations<br>
      No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created
      under this section unless brought within one year after the
      discovery of the facts constituting the cause of action and within
      three years after such cause of action accrued.<br>

      (5)The Commission shall consult with and consider the views of the
      Secretary of the Treasury prior to approving a proposed rule filed
      by a registered securities association that primarily concerns
      conduct related to transactions in government securities, except
      where the Commission determines that an emergency exists requiring
      expeditious or summary action and publishes its reasons therefor.
      If the Secretary of the Treasury comments in writing to the
      Commission on a proposed rule that has been published for comment,
      the Commission shall respond in writing to such written comment
      before approving the proposed rule. If the Secretary of the
      Treasury determines, and notifies the Commission, that such rule,
      if implemented, would, or as applied does (i) adversely affect the
      liquidity or efficiency of the market for government securities;
      or (ii) impose any burden on competition not necessary or
      appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section, the
      Commission shall, prior to adopting the proposed rule, find that

      purposes of this section notwithstanding the Secretary=E2=80=99s

      district court of the United States or United States court of<br>
      any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
      United States, alleging that a person serving or acting in one or
      more of the following capacities has been guilty, after the
      enactment of this title and within five years of the commencement
      of the action, of gross misconduct or gross abuse of trust in
      respect of any registered investment company for which such person
      so serves or acts:<br>
      (1) as officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment
      adviser, or depositor; or<br>
      (2) as principal underwriter, if such registered company is an
      open-end company, unit investment trust, or face-amount<br>

      If the Commission's allegations of such gross misconduct or gross
      abuse of trust are established, the court shall enjoin such person

      the preservation of which has been required pursuant to section 31
